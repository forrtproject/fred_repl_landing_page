# Replication Summary Landing Page

A simple, responsive landing page to display metadata and connections between original and replicated studies.




## Contribution

I created an alternative version (`index2.html`) inside the `landingpage2/` folder with:
- Clean folder structure for deployment
- Updated API logic to handle outcome variants
- Fixed summary counting and fallback handling
- Ready for GitHub Pages deployment
